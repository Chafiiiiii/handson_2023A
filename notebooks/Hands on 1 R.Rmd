## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## g) Create an array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100, and then calculate the mean and standard deviation of the array.


```{r}
a<-c(12,41,23,12,15,97,42,16,78,46)
a<-array(a)
cat ("The value of the mean is: ",mean(a), "\n")
cat("The value of the SDT is: ",sd(a),"\n")
```
## The second way to implement the same exercise


```{r}

rd_a<- sample(1:100,10)
cat("The current values of the array is: ",rd_a,"\n")
cat ("The value of the mean is: ",mean(rd_a),"\n")
cat ("The value of the mean is: ",sd(rd_a),"\n")
```
## h) Create a 2-dimensional array of 3 rows and 4 columns with random integer values. Then, calculate the sum of each row and column.
```{r}
#First we need to create the random integer values 
array <- matrix(sample.int(100, 3 * 4), nrow = 3)
#Then we need to calculate the sum of each row
cat("The value of the sum of each row is:",sum(array))
```
## i) Create a DataFrame with 3 columns: "Name", "Age", and "City". Add at least 5 rows of data to the DataFrame. Then, filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the person's age is greater than or equal to 30
```{r}
df <- data.frame(Nombre = c("Andres", "Juan", "Pedro", "Veronica", "Mireya"),
                  Edad= c(21, 26, 23, 32, 97),
                  Ciudad = c("Quito", "Cuenca", "Manta", "El Oro", "Guayaquil"))

print(df)
# Filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the person's age is greater than or equal to 30
df_filtered <- df[df$Age >= 30, ]
print("filtered")
# Print the filtered DataFrame
print(df_filtered)
```
## (k) Load a CSV file into a DataFrame and then calculate the mean, median, and mode of one of the columns in the DataFrame.
```{r}
# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
data <- read.csv("decks.csv")

# Calculate the mean of a column
mean_value <- mean(data$Lands..without.MDFCs)

# Calculate the median of a column
median_value <- median(data$Lands..without.MDFCs)

# Calculate the mode of a column
mode_value <- names(table(data$Lands..without.MDFCs))[table(data$Lands..without.MDFCs) == max(table(data$Lands..without.MDFCs))]

# Print the results
cat("Mean:", mean_value, "\n")
cat("Median:", median_value, "\n")
cat("Mode:", mode_value, "\n")

```

##(l) Create a scatter plot of random x and y values between 1 and 100.

```{r}
# Generate random values for x and y
x <- runif(100, min = 1, max = 100)
y <- runif(100, min = 1, max = 100)

# Create the scatter plot
plot(x, y, pch = 16, col = "blue", xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Scatter Plot")

# Add labels to the axes
axis(1, cex.axis = 0.8)
axis(2, cex.axis = 0.8)

# Add a grid
grid()

# Add legend
legend("topleft", legend = "Points", pch = 16, col = "blue")

```


## (m) Load a CSV file into a DataFrame and then create a line chart of one of the columns in the DataFrame.

```{r}
# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
data <- read.csv("decks.csv")

# Specify the column index for the line chart
column_index <- 3

# Create a line chart of the column
plot(data[, column_index], type = "l", xlab = "Index", ylab = names(data)[column_index], main = "Line Chart")



```
